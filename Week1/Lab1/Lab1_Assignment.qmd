# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to review basic data manipulation and plotting in python.

# Problem 1

## Inspection of the data

In the code below I am loading the required libraries to load the file that is needed to answer Problem 1.
I will also be loading the Auto data. Finally making that the missing values have been removed from the data.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load data - replacing '?' with NaN and dropping them
auto = pd.read_csv('DataSets/Auto.csv', na_values='?')
auto = auto.dropna()
# (a) Identify types
# quantitative: mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year
# qualitative: origin, name
print(auto.dtypes)


```

## a. Which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?

Quantitative: mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year.

Qualitative: origin, name. (Note: cylinders and origin are integers but often treated as categorical; however, for this context, origin is strictly qualitative/categorical).

## b. What is the range of each quantitative predictor? You can answer this using the min() and max() methods in numpy.
```{python}
# (b) & (c) Summary stats for quantitative predictors
quant_cols = ['mpg', 'cylinders', 'displacement', 'horsepower', 'weight', 'acceleration', 'year']
min_max = auto[quant_cols].agg(['min', 'max'])
print(min_max)
```
